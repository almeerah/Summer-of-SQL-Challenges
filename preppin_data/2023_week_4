/*
REQUIREMENTS

- We want to stack the tables on top of one another, since they have the same fields in each sheet.
- Drag each table into the canvas and use a union step to stack them on top of one another
- Use a wildcard union in the input step of one of the tables
- Some of the fields aren't matching up as we'd expect, due to differences in spelling. Merge these fields together
- Make a Joining Date field based on the Joining Day, Table Names and the year 2023
- Now we want to reshape our data so we have a field for each demographic, for each new customer
- Make sure all the data types are correct for each field
- Remove duplicates 
- If a customer appears multiple times take their earliest joining date

Output the data
